                <h1>Balloon TakeOff</h1>
                <p> Balloon TakeOff aims to provide a visual an auditory experience for practing 
                    the box-breathing and 4-7-8 breathing technique. This project was inspired from
                    the breathing technique my 6th grade English teacher taught me while I was experiencing
                    my first panic attack in middle school. My teacher took me outside of the class, sat me down
                    and told me to imagine I was holding a deflated air balloon. He told me to imagine putting all 
                    things I'm worried about in the balloon. Once I'm done, he then tells me to begin inflating
                    it by taking deep breaths. Once I'm done inflating, he tells me to lift the balloon up and 
                    imagine it heading higher off to the sky.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    Balloon TakeOff takes one through how I felt and pictured the moment in which my 
                    teacher walked me through deep breathing.Balloon Takeoff can be viewed as a 3 step activity:
                    Activity 1: Writing worries out.
                    Activity 2: 3 repetitions of deep breaths
                    Activity 3: Watching the release of the balloon.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                    Balloon TakeOff was made using three.js for animations and 3D visuals of the balloon and stars. 
                    HTML/CSS as well as Javascript were used for creating the styling and functionality of the game.
                    Music was made using MAX, Reaper, and some sampled sounds. When I write, sing, or play music, 
                    I picture a scene like in a movie or music video that I am capturing. Each song plays a different
                    scene in a story of serenity that I imagine in that very moment I play.
