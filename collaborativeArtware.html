                        <h1> Netizens Collaborative WhiteBoard:To Draw & Listen To Music</h1>

                        <p> Collaborative Artware is an experimental online drawing application made
                            by me and other Media Art and Design at UChicago during our internet art III class.
                            Collaborative Artware  was motivated by the question, " How should we create a website that is 
                            both functional and experimental?" Additionally, Collaborative Artware was inspired by the way that 
                            creative technologists work on commerical projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This project forced us to think about other medias and ways to inspire creativity, increase unity,
                            and increase fun amongst netizens. In the end, Collaborative Artware allows for one to select an avatar, 
                            join an independent drawing board where they can create images to then use in the shared collaboration board. 
                            Once the user is on the collaborative drawing board, they can draw and play music that someone else who is also on 
                            the collaborative drawing board may view and hear.
                            Anonymity is a topic frequently discussed and something we want our users to explore while they are 
                            only able to interact with others through drawings and music preferences.
                            With this, we raise the question, "How would the creativity experience for the user feel when collaboration is anonymous? "
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the duration of this project, I was involved with the creative process and more particulary in 
                            the design and incorporation of music within the collaborative space. This was my first exploration in internet music.
                            I was able to allow shared music across all users on the page by having them user upload the Youtube Music video they would 
                            like to listen to. When a user uploads, pauses, or unpauses the same output will occur for other users on the collaborative space.
                            Why did I have them upload YouTube videos? Well as it turns out, different browsers process audio differently. 
                            This makes it difficult to achieve shared music audio. This approach led me to learn about using YouTube's YTsampler. 
                            Collaborative Artware is a website made using HTML/CSS, & Javascript.
